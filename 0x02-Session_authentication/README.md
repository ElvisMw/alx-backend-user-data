Task Breakdown
Task 1: Data Collection
•	Objective: Gather all necessary data for the project.
•	Instructions:
1.	Identify data sources.
2.	Download data files.
3.	Store data in the data/raw directory.

Task 2: Data Cleaning
•	Objective: Clean the collected data to ensure it is suitable for analysis.
•	Instructions:
1.	Remove duplicates.
2.	Handle missing values.
